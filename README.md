# Recyclyze

## What is it
Recyclyze is a responsive cross platform mobile application created to aid people in learning how to properly sort and dispose of their waste as well as keep track of what days different types of waste are collected.

User can ask BinBot any waste disposal, reducuction, reuse, recycling, etc. related questions. They can also take a picture or sepect a photo from their gallery of waste they have to be analyzed. Location can be set in the settings under the light/dark mode toggle. Images will then automatically take location into account when returning information on watse disposal.

The built in Calendar allows events such as different collection days to be saved (will be able to send reminders soon).

There is a history screen where all the responses for analyzed images and search promots will be saved and able to be viewed again (responses are pre-sorted into Recycling, Garbage, Compost and Miscellaneous bins).
